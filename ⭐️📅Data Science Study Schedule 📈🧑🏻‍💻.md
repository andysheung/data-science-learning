## Daily Session Structure (Shorter Days)

**First 5 minutes:**

- Review yesterday's key learnings
- Set specific goal for today

**Main Block (70-80%):**

- Deliberate practice on target skill
- Push yourself, struggle with problems

**Last 15-20 minutes:**

- Document what you learned
- Identify what's still unclear
- Prepare tomorrow's focus

## Project Days Structure (Longer Days)

**Start of each 3h block:**

- 5 min: Clear goal for this block
- Review relevant code/concepts

**During:**

- Work in 50-minute focused sprints
- 10-minute breaks between sprints

**End of block:**

- Git commit with clear message
- Document blockers or questions

## Key Principles

1. **Progression:** Each week builds on previous weeks
2. **Integration:** Projects use skills from practice days
3. **Feedback:** Compare your code to expert solutions regularly
4. **Documentation:** Keep learning journal, track weak points
5. **Rest:** One full rest day (maybe reduce Sunday if needed)

## Resources to Use

**LeetCode:** Focus on Easy/Medium, data structure heavy **Kaggle Learn:** Quick micro-courses on specific topics **Kaggle Datasets:** For projects at all levels **PyTorch Tutorials:** Official docs are excellent **Real Python:** Deep dives on Python topics

## Tracking Progress

Create a simple spreadsheet:

- Week number & theme
- Daily accomplished tasks
- Time spent in deep focus
- Skills mastered vs still struggling
- Project completion status

## Adjustments After 8 Weeks

After this rotation:

- Review your tracking sheet
- Identify weakest areas
- Design another 8-week cycle focusing on gaps
- Increase difficulty of projects

**Does this structure work for you? Would you like me to adjust the focus areas or create more detailed day-by-day breakdowns for specific weeks?**
