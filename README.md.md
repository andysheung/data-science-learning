## 💡 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows **deliberate practice** principles:

1. **Focus on weaknesses** - Identify struggles and attack them systematically
2. **Immediate feedback** - Test code frequently, compare to expert solutions
3. **Document everything** - Especially failures and breakthroughs
4. **Spaced repetition** - Review previous learnings regularly
5. **Push comfort zone** - Always work slightly beyond current ability
6. **Measure progress** - Track time, confidence levels, speed improvements

### Key Practices

- ✅ Code every single day, no exceptions
- ✅ Document before moving on (5-10 min per session)
- ✅ Review yesterday's notes before starting
- ✅ Weekly self-assessment and adjustment
- ✅ Focus on doing, not just watching tutorials

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas

### This Week's Priorities

1. **Pandas filtering** - Master boolean indexing and complex conditions
2. **GroupBy operations** - Understand groupby, transform, apply
3. **Data cleaning** - Handle missing data, duplicates, type conversions
4. **LeetCode basics** - Array and string manipulation

- Datetime operations
- Memory optimization for large datasets
- Object-oriented programming
- Testing and debugging

## 💬 Notes to Self

> "Struggling for 30-45 minutes before looking at solutions is where real learning happens. Don't skip the struggle."

> "Review previous day's learnings before starting. That 5 minutes pays dividends."

> "Document your struggles immediately while they're fresh. Future you will thank present you."

> "It's okay to feel stuck. Progress isn't linear. Trust the process."
